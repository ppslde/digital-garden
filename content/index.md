Hi my name is Danny and I'm a software engineer. I have a passion for technology and enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts.
This is a loose collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that I find interesting or useful.
I hope you find something here that resonates with you.

FÃ¼r alle die der Aufbau meiner [[quartz-infrastructure]] interessiert, habe ich einige Informationen und Ressourcen zusammengestellt.
